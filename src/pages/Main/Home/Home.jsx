                Welcome to the warehouse management system I developed. This project is completed by me independently. Due to the hasty completion, it does not look gorgeous. Although it looks rudimentary, the structure of the whole APP is very complete, and it almost covers most of the functions of a simple and practical APP. The purpose of building this APP is mainly to show the interviewer my programming thinking, technology stack and data flow control. From architecture design, front-end, back-end, and cloud server deployment, I did it by myself. For specific development ideas, functional design, and technical content, please refer to the link below, which contains a detailed description. I hope the interviewer can understand my programming thinking and technical characteristics by reading this document. I hope I can leave a deep impression on the interviewers, thank you very much
